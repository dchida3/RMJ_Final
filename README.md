## Project Description
Our web application – Rate My Job – is an engine which aids users in searching and evaluating different jobs and companies. Users can post reviews about what they think about certain positions at certain companies as well as search for their ideal jobs based on different criteria, such as work culture and company benefits. 

## Project Usefulness
Our project provides a platform for users to narrow down their job search based on their personal preferences. It allows others to share their experiences and offer advice on what the workflow was like in certain companies and whether they would recommend working there. There is a lot of concern in choosing a career that is a right fit especially since jobs typically involve a long-term commitment of several years. Our application would help others gain a better understanding of the company they might be considering applying to or position they might be considering accepting. Our engine’s platform is specifically for technical companies and positions, so the demographic for our platform would be narrower than other job-review engines such as Glassdoor or Indeed. Our application also allows users to post specific questions so that other users can offer their personal input as well as a recommendation tool for users to input their most important aspects in selecting a job. Our application will then recommend a company for them to work at given the specific importance in criteria that they stated.
